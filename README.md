# Erika_3004_Rust

This is a project inspired by https://github.com/Chaostreff-Potsdam/erika3004/blob/master/README.md. It allows to interact with an Erika 3004 over the internet via an ESP32.
This ReadMe will be updated over time.

## State
Currently the code is in some kind of alpha and is still under development. Do not expect for things to just work.
